    <h2>About The Singer Manufacturing Company</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>The Singer Manufacturing Company</strong> has been making sewing
      machines since the 1800s. Over time, Singer became a familiar name in a lot
      of homes, from professional dressmakers to people just hemming their own jeans.

        Our main goal is simple: 
        create sewing machines that normal people can actually use,  
        that last a long time, and don’t feel scary or complicated.

      <h3>How the Featherweight Fits Into the Story</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Featherweight 221</strong> is one of the smaller machines in
        the Singer family. It was made to be light, portable and cute, but still
        strong enough to actually do work.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a lot of people, the Featherweight feels like part sewing machine,
        part little collectible. It shows how Singer tried to mix technology,
        design and everyday life in one tiny black machine.
