    <h2>Need Help With Your Featherweight 221?</h2>
    <p>
      This page is a simple “support corner” for the Singer Featherweight 221.
      It’s written like a little retro help page: basic tips, what to check,
      and how to reach out for more support.

      <h3>Quick Things to Check First</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure the machine is plugged in and the power switch is on.</li>
        <li>Check that the presser foot is lowered before you start sewing.</li>
        <li>Re-thread the top thread slowly, following the guides.</li>
        <li>Make sure the bobbin is placed correctly and turning the right way.</li>
        <li>Use a fresh needle if the stitches look uneven or the fabric is snagging.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Featherweight 221 – Simple FAQ</h3>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h4>My stitches look messy. What do I do?</h4>
        <p>
          First, re-thread the top thread and bobbin completely. Then try again
          with a piece of scrap fabric. If it’s still messy, gently adjust the
          tension dial in small steps.

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h4>The machine won’t start.</h4>
        <p>
          Check the outlet, the plug, and the power switch on the machine.
          Make sure the foot controller is connected properly. If nothing works,
          unplug it and contact a service center.

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h4>Can I still get parts?</h4>
        <p>
          In the real world, many shops and collectors still sell parts for the
          Featherweight 221. For this project site, please imagine contacting a
          local Singer dealer or vintage sewing specialist.
